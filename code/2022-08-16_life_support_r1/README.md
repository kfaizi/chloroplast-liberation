status: Rejected
reason: This was my first attempt at isolating chloroplasts and imaging them on the microplate reader. Unlike my second attempt, I did not obtain a clear chloroplast fraction. The plate reader settings were also suboptimal. However, I learned that some of my control conditions were redundant.

## Notes and Observations
Starting off with about $10^8$ cc-400 cells, which is far less than the $10^{10}$ cells (5 mg chlorophyll _a_) the protocol calls for. (This is likely a major reason this first attempt was unsuccessful).

I used 10 mL of CIB, and spun everything down in Percoll gradients made in 50 mL Falcon tubes.

I think I can see a (green) chloroplast band, but it's extremely faint and hard to retrieve with a pipette. I tried spinning something down twice but can't see a pellet. Again, this is because I didn't have enough starting material.

## Summary of Results
I have not attempted to analyse the results of this experiment, since I immediately followed up with another improved attempt.

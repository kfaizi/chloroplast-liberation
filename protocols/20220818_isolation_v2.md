this is 2022-08-18: my final big life support run

It actually worked -- I isolated chloroplasts!

Today I
- noticed glutathione asks for refrigeration; I moved it into the cold room but it has been at RT up to now.
- Made gradients in those ~15 mL plastic tubes I use for overnight liquid bacterial cultures, instead of 50 mL falcons. I reasoned that this would make the fraction boundaries thicker and easier to retrieve, and probably improve their resolution (more travel distance). However, making them was harder than I remembered for the 50mLs -- I only got 1, maybe 2, decent columns after trying to make 4. Had to work really really slowly with a p1000 (serological  disrupted the boundaries immediately). Marked what seemed like my best one. Whew. 
- Around 6pm: I have 7x10^5 cells/mL and ~800 mL culture. Call that 10^9 cells. Spun down in 50 mL falcons, decanted supe, and added around 45 mL of HEPES-KOH. Spun down 5 min. Realized I didn't resuspend in the HEPES first afterwards, so tried to vortex/shake to resup but didn't work. So, I dumped off the supe and resuspended each pellet in the approx 500 uL that remained in each tube, then consolidated. Came out to 7.5 mL volume. Spun this down for 5 min at 3320 rcf; this constituted my HEPES wash. I then removed all but 2 mL of supe, and resuspended the pellet in this. Into cold room now...
- Added 8 mL CIB and passed everything through the needle. As usual, did so inside of a 50 mL falcon tube, squeezing the sides as needed to get the syringe inside. No issues here, went smoothly.
- Centrifuged and saved the supe as "soup" at 4C.
- Resuspended gently (this took a few slow minutes) with the paintbrush until almost all clumps were gone. Slowly layered 1 mL on top of my nicest gradient, and the remaining almost 1 mL onto the other one. Spun down for 18 min not 15, since CF only goes up to 3220 rcf not 4k.
- I got the most beautiful bands! Took some pics. Finally -- a clear thylakoid band, and a clear CP band! CPs are kinda clumpy/dotty, not a smooth gradient. Was straightforward to retrieve them using a p1000, no macgyvering a glass pipet needed!
- Centrifuged twice in my attempts to remove the percoll (pellet was easily disturbed on my first try). Same settings both times.
- I also performed all these steps for the thylakoid fraction in parallel, thinking I'd like to try measuring that too. But I kinda gave up halfway when I accidentally lost the pellet during the percoll removal lol, and just tossed it.
- Resuspended w/ paintbrush (etoh and kimwipe dry between uses of course) in 300 uL of cool TP.

For the plate, layout is:
3X 100 uL whole cells, 100 uL CPs, 2X 100 uL CPs + 100 uL soup
3X 100 uL soup
3x 100 ul TP
3x 100 ul CIB
3x 100 ul CIB + 100 ul TP, 3x 50 ul CIB + 50 ul TP

For whole cells, I spun down ~45 mLs of my initial culture (about 10^7 cells) for 10 min at 3220 rcf. Resupped in 2 mL TP, which should give about 5x10^5 cells per 100 uL aliquot.

(96 wells have recommened working volume of 75-200 uL, mostly using 100 uL here)

Settings largely the same as last time, but
- reads every 2 min
- reads for 10 hours
- using bottom optics this time
- temp was already at 25C this time

There was a roughly 20 min delay between isolating the CPs and starting the plate read, FYI.

Took pics of other settings/details for later recording.

# Algal Chloroplast Isolation 

## Description
This method, adapted from Mason et al. 2006, is for the isolation of pure intact chloroplasts from _Chlamydomonas reinhardtii_ cells by passing them through a narrow-bore syringe needle followed by sucrose gradient centrifugation. Areas where I've deviated significantly from the source material are marked with a `NOTE`.

## Recipes
### 5X GR buffer (20 mL)
| **Reagent** | **Amount** | **Final Concentration** |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Sodium pyrophosphate (Na<sub>4</sub>P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>) `NOTE: paper makes a typo and calls it Na2P2O7` | 2.23 g | 5 mM |
| HEPES | 59.58 g | 250 mM |
| D-sorbitol | 300.6 g | 1.65 M |
| 0.5 M Na-EDTA, pH 8.0 | 20 mL | 10 mM |
| Magnesium chloride hexahydrate (MgCl<sub>2</sub>-6H<sub>2</sub>O) | 1.10 g | 5 mM |
| Manganese chloride (MnCl<sub>2</sub>) | 0.99 g | 5 mM |
| Sodium hydroxide solution (NaOH) | 6M | variable |

1. In a sterile 1L bottle with a clean stir bar, combine 750 mL milliQ water with all ingredients except the sodium pyrophosphate.
2. Separately, bring 20 mL milliQ water to a boil in a small Erlenmeyer flask (e.g. by microwaving).
3. Dissolve the pyrophosphate in the hot water by stirring.
4. Combine the two solutions and titrate to pH 6.8 using 6M NaOH. This will take some time due to the buffering effect of the HEPES.
5. Measure the total volume of the stock, e.g. using a large graduated cylinder. If applicable, dilute to 1 L with more milliQ water (or make note of the final concentration, if greater).
6. Store at -20C in 20 mL aliquots.

### PCBF (~17.5 mL)
| **Reagent** | **Amount** |
| :--: | :--: |
| Percoll | 17.5 mL |
| Ficoll | 0.18 g |
| Bovine serum albumin (BSA) | 0.18 g |
| Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), m.w. 6000 `NOTE: I substituted PEG 8000 since it was all that was available` | 0.525 g |

1. In a sterile bottle or flask with a clean stir bar, add the Percoll.
2. Add the dry ingredients and mix with stirring. The Percoll will be cold and viscous, and the dry ingredients tend to clump, so this will take some time -- adding each component slowly may help. Stirring too vigorously will create foamy bubbles and should be avoided.
3. Store at 4C and use within 48h.

**Tips:**
- Percoll and BSA should be stored at 4C.
- Percoll is easily contaminated, so use good aseptic technique when handling the stock and any PCBF you make.
- This recipe makes enough PCBF for 4 gradient columns, but it is probably best to make it in larger batches, since mixing it can be quite annoying.

### Isoascorbate buffer (50 mL)
| **Reagent** | **Amount** |
| :--: | :--: |
| Isoascorbic acid | 4.4 g |
| HEPES | 0.595 g |
| NaOH | 6M |

1. In a sterile 100 mL bottle with a clean stir bar, combine 40 mL milliQ water with all dry ingredients.
2. Titrate to pH 7.0 using 6M NaOH.
3. Measure the total volume of the stock, e.g. using a large graduated cylinder. If applicable, dilute to 50 mL with more milliQ water (or make note of the final concentration, if greater).
4. Store at -20C in 1 mL aliquots.


### 50mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5 (1 L)
| **Reagent** | **Amount** |
| :--: | :--: |
| HEPES | 11.9 g |

1. In a sterile 1 L bottle with a clean stir bar, combine 950 mL milliQ water with the HEPES.
2. Titrate to pH 7.5 with 2M KOH.
3. Measure the total volume of the stock, e.g. using a large graduated cylinder. If applicable, dilute to 1 L with more milliQ water (or make note of the final concentration, if greater).
4. Store at RT in the dark (e.g. wrapped in foil) to discourage oxidation.


### Chloroplast isolation buffer (500 mL)
| **Reagent** | **Amount** | **Final concentration** |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| D-sorbitol | 27.4 g | 300 mM |
| HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5 | 5.96 g | 50 mM |
| 0.5 M Na-EDTA, pH 8.0 | 2 mL | 2 mM |
| MgCl<sub>2</sub>-6H<sub>2</sub>O | 0.1 g | 1 mM |
| BSA | 5.0 g | 1% |

1. In a sterile 1 L bottle with a clean stir bar, combine 450 mL milliQ water with all ingredients. Use smooth movements as the mixture is prone to foaming.
2. Titrate to pH 7.0 with 2M KOH.  `NOTE: This step was added because the original protocol calls for pH-adjusted HEPES, yet provides a mass measurement in the recipe. The pH of the final mixture after addition of dry HEPES was 6.10.`
3. Measure the total volume of the stock, e.g. using a large graduated cylinder. If applicable, dilute to 500 mL with more milliQ water (or make note of the final concentration, if greater).
4. Store at 4C for up to two weeks.

## Protocol
### 1. Make Percoll (sucrose) gradients
| **Reagent** | **Amount (20%)** | **Amount (45%)** | **Amount (65%)** |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| 5X GR buffer | 2.36 mL | 2.36 mL | 2.36 mL |
| Isoascorbate buffer | 0.13 mL | 0.13 mL | 0.13 mL |
| Glutathione `NOTE: I used L-glutathione reduced, which should be equivalent` | 2.25 mg | 2.25 mg | 2.25 mg |
| PCBF | 2.63 mL | 5.90 mL | 8.50 mL |
| milliQ water | 8.00 mL | 4.75 mL | 2.11 mL |

1. Prepare the 3 discontinuous gradients by mixing the appropriate ingredients in 3 separate 50 mL Falcon tubes.
2. Mix well by vortexing, but avoid introducing too many bubbles (especially to the more viscous fractions). Let any bubbles settle briefly.
3. Layer the gradients together in 15 mL centrifuge tubes.
    a. Pipette 3 mL of the 65% mix into the bottom of the tube.
    b. Carefully overlay with 3 mL of the 45% mix by holding the tube at a 45 degree angle and slowly dripping the solution down the wall of the tube.
    c. Repeat with 3 mL of the 20% fraction.
4. Carefully inspect the gradients without disturbing them. Three distinct layers should be visible.
5. Store at 4C, taking care not to introduce shaking or vibration. Use within 48 h.

**Tips:**
- Glutathione should be stored at 4C.

### 2. Isolate chloroplasts
1. Grow a cell-wall-deficient strain (like cc-400) in minimal media under synchronous lighting. I use TP medium and a 12:12 hr light cycle. Before starting the protocol, you should ideally have 1 L of culture at a density of ~$10^{7}$ cells/mL (a vivid, turbid green), for a total of ~$10^{10}$ cells. I had 800 mL at ~$7 \times 10^5$ cells/mL, or around $10^{9}$ cells. 
    - Cell counts can be measured manually using a haemocytometer under a 40X objective, or automatically using a slide-based cell counter. Spectrophotometry is unlikely to be accurate, since the specific conversion factor will depend on cell size, which varies throughout the _C. reinhardtii_ cell cycle.
2. Harvest cells by centrifugation at 3220 _g_ for 10 min.
    - _When_ you do this is important. The original protocol specifies 4 hrs into the 3rd light cycle.
3. Decant the supernatant and gently resuspend the pellet in 100 mL of 50 mM HEPES-KOH. Centrifuge again for 5 min to wash.
4. Decant the supernatant once again, and resuspend the pellet in 2 mL of HEPES-KOH. Hold it at 4C. **All subsequent isolation steps should be carried out at 4C, e.g. in a cold room.**
5. Add 8 mL of chloroplast isolation buffer, then quickly draw the mixture into the syringe and attach the needle.
6. Lyse the cells by ejecting the mixture at a flow rate of 0.1 mL/s, collecting it in a clean Falcon tube.
7. Centrifuge at 750 _g_ for 2 min. This pellets whole cells and crude chloroplasts, leaving chloroplast-free cytoplasmic extract as supernatant. `NOTE: Collect the supe with careful pipetting and set it aside. It is technically mostly made up of isolation buffer, so an isolation buffer control is included later on the plate.`
8. Gently resuspend the pellet in 2 mL of chloroplast isolation buffer using the paintbrush. Any clumps will destroy the Percoll gradients, but being too forceful risks compromising chloroplast integrity.
9. Overlay the suspension on a Percoll gradient, and centrifuge at 3220 _g_ for 15 min. The result should be a sharp pattern of two bands. According to the protocol, thylakoids make up the top band; intact chloroplasts make up the middle band; and whole cells pass through to pellet at the bottom.
10. Collect chloroplasts with careful pipetting, and dilute in 10 mL of chloroplast isolation buffer. Centrifuge at 670 _g_ for 1 min to remove any excess Percoll. (`NOTE: I had to centrifuge twice before the removal of Percoll was satisfactory.`)
11. Resuspend the pellet in 300 uL of TP, once again using the paintbrush. (`NOTE: I cleaned the paintbrush between uses using 70% EtOH and a Kimwipe.`)
12. You have now successfully isolated chloroplasts and a cytoplasmic fraction from bulk chlamy cells. Note the time. Continue to keep everything at 4C and move on to Data Collection as quickly as possible.

### 3. Data collection
1. In a black, clear-bottom, lidded 96-well plate, prepare all needed experimental conditions in triplicate. A typical layout might be:

| **Wells** | **Sample** | **Volume (uL)** | **Notes** |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| A1-3 | Whole cells in TP | 100 | positive control |
| A4-6 | Chloroplasts in TP | 100 | normal chloroplast survival _ex vivo_ |
| A7-9 | Chloroplasts in TP + cytoplasmic extract (1:1) | 200 | life support condition |
| B1-3 | Cytoplasmic extract | 100 | negative control |
| C1-3 | TP medium | 100 | negative control |
| D1-3 | Chloroplast isolation buffer (CIB) | 100 | negative control |

Quantify the whole cells before use. In future iterations, chloroplast yields should also be quantified.

2. Measure chlorophyll autofluorescence on a plate reader. For the Silver lab's Synergy H1, I used the following parameters:

#### Instrument settings
| Instrument | BioTek Synergy H1 Microplate Reader |
|:--:| :--:|
| Plate Type | 96 well with lid |
| Temperature | 25°C |
| Run Type | kinetic |
| Shaking Mode | orbital (continuous) |
| Run Duration | 10h |
| Read Interval | 2m |
| Read Speed | normal |
| Read Type | fluorescence (440 nm, 680 nm) | 
| Optics Type | bottom |

Depending on the temperature chosen, the device may need to preheat/cool before use, so be sure to do so beforehand.

3. Export the raw bulk data as a tabular text file and proceed to analysis as indicated in the accompany Jupyter Notebook.
